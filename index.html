    <h1>Valley of the Giants</h1>
    <p>In a lonely mountain village overlooking the valley of giants, there is a curious ritual where all children must travel into the wilds on their twelfth birthday to slay a giant and steal its soul. You play as the latest twelve year old to undertake the coming of age ritual, though you enter the wilds with a goal unlike any other. You want to befriend the biggest, meanest giant of them all.</p>
